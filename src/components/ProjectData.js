    text: "*Production Approved* <br /> <h4>Purpose</h4> Query Level is a Google Shopping Ads app targeting e-commerce vendors. As an e-commerce vendor in the past, I came across a very powerful marketing strategy that required a series of steps in structuring your Google Shopping campaigns.<br /> <h4> The strategy </h4> The strategy creates a filter-like system that allows you to bid high on buy-phase keywords and low on interest-level queries. <br /> <h4> The Problem </h4>The problem with the strategy is it requires you to create negative keywords and carefully structure your campaigns. One mistake and you could be seeing some unusual or unintended performance. Moreover, if you have hundreds of products for each brand you carry, the manual work of creating negative keywords within the constraints of Google is painstaking and long. <br /> <h4> The Solution </h4>This app solves all of that in a few clicks. Users can simply connect to the app, choose the brand they want to create the structured campaigns for, configure some specific settings like cost per click, location and bid separations, and click 'create campaigns' and they're done. This app provides a centralized Google ads Shopping experience. App is CRUD equipped for shopping campaigns, conversions, search terms, and Stripe for subscriptions.",

Teacher buffets are timed segments where employers can view all currently active teachers and recruit them to apply for open positions. Once the window is closed, access is locked off. Employers can purchase segments of 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days and 1 month. The hope here is that it becomes easier for others to find a job and not rely on the few options out there at the moment. <h4>Solutions</h4> Ajarn jobs offers variety in the job finding hustle and gives employers on budget an affordable posting option.",
